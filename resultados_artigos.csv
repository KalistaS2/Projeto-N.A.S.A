Mice in Bion-M 1 space mission: training and selection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136787/,"A seção 'Discussion' foi encontrada, mas não continha texto de parágrafo extraível.","The Bion-M 1 flight was unique in many ways, particularly the unprecedented duration of an automated mission with living animals. The sex of the mice was male, thus imposing greater attention to creation and selection of stable groups of mice for social housing. The overall success was evident: aggressive interactions were noted on single occasions and under conditions of starvation only. The use of male animals is obviously required for research in male reproduction and their larger size compared to females offered clear advantages. Our program of mice training for flight and control experiments of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed to: ensure that mice adapt to stressful conditions of space flight when housed in groups; to collect baseline data from these mice; select homogenous groups; and, more generally, to promote collection of less variable data. The results of our program presented here demonstrate that group housed male mice need not be excludeda priori, but quite on the contrary, can be successfully employed in space biomedical research if clear and simple procedures provided by this study are followed.

The failures in this project were connected with hardware malfunction in food distribution system and to microgravity-related changes in mouse behavior. Some of the injuries and deaths encountered in this pioneering effort suggest moving parts within the habitat present potential risks and should be avoided or carefully analyzed in the design of future mouse habitats.

In this space experiment we have, for the first time, introduced implantable telemetry in these small laboratory animals. This shift to data collection during the flight became possible with the development of miniature implantable probes, thereby dramatically increasing the scientific output of such experiments. Moreover, the use of an automated data collection system during the post-flight stage of this experiment provided comprehensive data on the course and mechanism of recovery of varied physiological systems following exposure to microgravity. The unprecedented inclusion of daily video recordings proved valuable for scientific purposes, for animal welfare considerations, and for assessing both nominal and aberrant events.

The good condition of spaceflight mice was the basis for the positive results of both the recovery and tissue sharing studies; leading us to conclude that our training program was generally effective. We express our hope that the results and considerations presented here will be useful for the planning of future missions and will help to ensure the welfare of rodents in space research.",
"Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,"In this study, we investigated cellular and molecular gene expression mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space, with an emphasis on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities in the pelvic girdle and proximal femur of 16-week-old C57BL/6J female mice. Although data in this field is not extensive, exposure to microgravity is known to alter bone homeostasis, causing primarily increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and possibly inhibition of bone formation. Here we sought to test the hypothesis that like osteoclastic activity, osteogenic cell cycle arrest and increased osteocytic osteolysis, may also contribute to bone loss in space.

We first characterized standard bone mineral and structural parameters following spaceflight to establish the magnitude of bone loss in our microgravity model system. Our results confirm the ischium portion of the pelvis (Fig. 1A) lost 6.3% (p = 0.005) bone volume fraction and 11.9% (p = 0.002) in bone thickness (Table 1) with an accompanying reduction in trabecular bridges between ischial surfaces (Fig. 1E–G). In addition, bone loss was accompanied by large increases in osteoclast numbers (197%) and osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces measured in the femoral head (154%) (Fig. 3A–D). This observed initial (15-day) rate of bone loss, translated to approximately 12%–24% loss per month, is high compared to established long-term astronaut bone loss values of 1–2% per month. The high-levels of osteoclastic activity we observed may, however, subside after the initial transition to microgravity. On earth at 1 g, patients with tetraplegia show an initial phase of pronounced cancellous bone loss, up to 30%, that subsides one-year post onset of paralysis[37]. Bed rest also results in increased osteoclast activity within 24 h of immobilization[38], and 120 d bed rest causes increased bone resorption surfaces in the pelvis by osteoclasts[39]. After this initial phase of osteoclastic resorption in patients, cortical bone loss continues, although at a reduced rate that is medically more manageable. If osteoclastic activity returns to normal after a period of transition after unloading, continued bone loss may correspond to reduced osteogenic activity and osteocytic osteolysis. Finally, the geometry of the ischium in flight samples is also altered with a wider marrow cavity conformation than ground controls (Fig. 1B–D,Table 2). Specifically, bone geometry near the ischial tuberosity, which provides a hindlimb muscle attachment surface, appears most altered. Among the muscles attaching to the ischium, the quadratus femoris plays an important “antigravity” role in maintaining a neutral hind-limb posture and can atrophy in microgravity[40], possibly explaining the high levels of bone loss we observed in the pelvis.

Having established that microgravity induces high-levels of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in our model system, we then sought to determine if osteocytic osteolysis was also activated. Osteocytes, are the most abundant cell type in bone and are thought to play a role in spaceflight-induced bone loss[41],[42],[43]. Lacunar enlargement was previously reported in a 22-day spaceflight in the 1970s with juvenile rats but was not conclusively demonstrated[34]. However, mice subjected to hindlimb unloading do not show increased lacunar area, suggesting that osteocytic osteolysis does not play a role in bone loss due to hindlimb unloading at 1 g[36]. Using nanoCT (Fig. 2), we found no bone density differences in non-lacunar regions between flight and ground samples. However, flight samples did exhibit lacunar enlargement relative to ground controls, as well as decreased circularity, and increased canalicular diameter (Fig. 2C–G). These results suggest an increase in osteocytic degradation of lacunar surfaces and highlight a possible difference in the ground-based model for mechanical hindlimb unloading at 1 g versus unloading in microgravity. Furthermore, the number of TRAP-positive osteocytes in flight samples was increased compared to ground controls, with no apparent differences in cell death or lacunar emptying (Fig. 3E–H). Although TRAP is an iron containing enzyme known to be a specific and highly sensitive marker of bone resorption by osteoclasts, Nakanoet al(2004) also showed TRAP activity in osteocytes[44]. TRAP-active osteocytes in the trabecular and cortical bone may therefore contribute to bone resorption in lacunae[44]. Furthermore, Qinget al(2012) found that gene expression analysis of osteocyte-enriched bone from lactating mice exhibited increased expression of TRAP, as well as several other osteoclast specific genes such as cathepsin K, carbonic anhydrase 1 and 2, and MMP13[36]. TRAP may also be needed for normal bone mineral remodeling and endochondral ossification, as mice lacking TRAP exhibit an osteopetrotic phenotype[45]. It is currently debated whether osteocytes contribute to bone remodeling and loss during spaceflight (for full review see[33]), however, our results support a role for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis.

To further investigate osteocyte-mediated molecular mechanisms associated with bone loss in space, we analyzed gene expression changes relevant to bone extracellular matrix in marrow-free bone tissue containing predominantly osteocytes but also osteoblasts. We found increases in mRNA levels for several collagen molecules and laminin subunits, suggesting increased matrix remodeling, and significant up-regulation of mRNA for matrix metalloproteinases 1, 3, and 10 in flight samples compared to ground controls, while MMP inhibitors showed no statistically significant alterations in expression (Fig. 4,Table 3). Remarkably we also found that osteocytes embedded within the cortical bone of the proximal femur were strongly MMP10 positive in flight samples but not in ground controls, indicating that the up-regulation of MMP10 transcripts in flight samples may originate in osteocytes. ECM proteinases play a critical role in normal pericellular matrix remodeling following environmental stimuli, such as mechanical load, and matrix calcium regulation in normal physiological states as well as in many disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis[46],[47],[48]. Previous studies have shown that osteoclasts secrete MMP1 and 3 during bone remodeling[49]. Furthermore, stromelysins (MMP3 and 10) retain significant activity in the acidic environment found in osteoclast resorptive pits and are secreted by osteoclasts in the sub-osteoclastic resorptive zone[49]. The number of dendritic processes from an osteocyte also increases with age, indicating that osteocytes embedded within the mineralized matrix may have the ability to generate new processes[50],[51]. In total, this gene and protein expression data, together with the ability of osteocytes to express the osteoclast marker TRAP and MMP10, support a role for osteocytic osteolysis in microgravity.

In addition to a role for osteocytic osteolysis, we also hypothesized that bone loss in space may be mediated by intracellular signaling cascades that result in activation of p53 and p21 during osteogenesis. Tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) is a growth suppressor and a transcriptional regulator which modulates the expression of a wide range of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation[52]and p53 activation generally results in apoptosis. Mice null for p53 exhibit extensive blood tumors and an osteopetrotic bone phenotype, indicating a role for the p53 signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and degradation[29],[30]. Previous studies have also demonstrated that p53 levels are increased in the muscle of animals exposed to spaceflight[27]and that p53 knockout mice have preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb unloading[28]. In contrast to these findings we determined that mRNA expression levels of p53 in marrow free bone tissue was down-regulated and immunohistochemical analysis showed no nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation of p53. Furthermore, examination of osteocyte nuclei in lacunae from cortical bone of the femur also revealed no differences in the number of empty lacunae, or nuclei with pyknotic morphology in spaceflight versus ground control animals. Previous research, however, has found that hindlimb unloading can result in osteocyte apoptosis and bone loss in the lumbar region of the spine[41]. Research into spaceflight versus 1 g simulations of spaceflight has, however, found differences in bone loss mechanisms including in trabecular bone loss, cancellous mineralization, and bone resorption rates[53]. Our data, including decreased message levels of p53, lack of protein accumulation of p53, and no alterations in osteocytic cell death, suggests that in contrast to hindlimb unloading, osteocyte apoptosis is mostly absent in short-term spaceflight.

Previous studies have shown that periosteal bone formation is inhibited[25]and osteoblast populations are decreased[24]in response to spaceflight, however, the molecular mechanisms causing this arrest of bone formation are not yet known. In contrast to p53, which we found to be down-regulated, expression of CDKN1a/p21, a cell cycle arrest mediator immediately downstream of p53, and other stress response pathways were up-regulated during spaceflight (Fig. 6,Table 3), which may cause an inhibition of osteogenesis and bone formation. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that p21 in flight samples was strongly localized to osteoblast nuclei on the periosteal surface of the femur and near the femoral head. In addition, spaceflight animals showed increased nuclear p21 staining in muscle fibers attached to the femur. MRL mice, which regenerate cartilage, skin, hair follicles, and myocardium with high fidelity and without scarring[54], also lack p21 expression, providing evidence that p21 could play a role in inhibiting tissue regeneration. In addition, CDKN1a/p21 knockout mice also have a regenerative phenotype similar to MRL mice, with normal development, early entry into S phase of the cell cycle, enhanced proliferation, and sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis[31]. Elevated CDKN1a/p21 levels in spaceflight may therefore explain the observed reduction in osteogenesis and bone growth. The expression of CDKN1a/p21 may also occur in tissues, possibly resulting in a systemic cell cycle and tissue regenerative response. In addition to bone, our gene expression results also show accumulation of p21 in muscle (Fig. 6) and heart tissue (A. Kumar, E.A.C. Almeida, and R.K. Globus, unpublished results). One possible mechanism for systemic expression of CDKN1a/p21 in the mouse may be oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated levels of ROS can result in increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of antioxidants, which have been reported both in spaceflight and hindlimb-unloading studies[55],[56],[57],[58]. Although the effect of CDKN1a/p21 accumulation in muscle and cardiomyocytes is not addressed in this study, it is possible that a systemic activation of CDKN1a/p21 by ROS could be occurring and might interfere with generalized tissue proliferation, repair and regeneration.

Various other genes associated with cell cycle regulation were altered in response to spaceflight, including cell cycle arrest molecules and cell cycle regulation molecules (Table 3). Such molecules included up-regulation of Fbxo4 and Fbxo31 that have been shown to stimulate the ubiquitination of Ccnd1[59],[60],[61]. Ccnd1 promotes the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle and is also considered a mediator of signaling from extracellular stimuli to the cell cycle machinery. Furthermore, several of the up-regulated molecules, specifically, Ube2e3 and Mul1, are thought to be involved in cell growth arrest due to mitochondrial fragmentation. Although we have found no cellular evidence of increased apoptosis, several apoptosis-related genes were also up-regulated in flight samples including Cradd, Dapk1, Fbxo31, Hecw2 and MAPK10 (Table 3). The expression of these genes without increased cellular indications of apoptosis could be related to the survival-promoting function of p21 when the cell cycle is arrested.

In order to determine the influence of spaceflight on osteogenic signaling pathways, we conducted RT-qPCR analysis of growth factor transcripts for genes involved in osteogenesis, bone mineralization, and their regulatory transcription factors. Altered growth factor binding in particular, can have significant impacts on intracellular signaling cascades and gene expression. We found message expression reductions in TGF-β2; FGF1 and 3; BMP4; Egr1; and Csf3 (Fig. 5,Table 3). Tgf-β is produced by osteoblasts and deposited in bone matrix during bone formation, and released by osteoclasts during bone resorption[62]. Additionally, Tgf-β induces proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts while inhibiting osteoclast precursor differentiation and bone resorption[63],[64]. Decreased levels of Tgf-β in the hindlimb of flight samples compared to ground controls has previously been reported. Tgf-β has also been suggested to play a critical role in the mechanosensing ability of bone and bone cells by serving as an intracellular messenger between strain responsive cells and other bone cells[65]. Decreased levels of Tgf-β in the periosteum but not in the cancellous compartment of the hindlimb, correlated with decreases in periosteal bone formation and mineral deposition rates, are suggestive of a role for Tgf-β in mechanical-loading-induced bone formation.

We also found decreases in the expression levels of Bmp4 message (Table 3), which is one of the most potent inducers of bone formation through stimulation of osteoblast differentiation. It has recently been shown that Bmp4-induced cell cycle arrest during osteoblast differentiation is dependent on the induction of p21 and p27 expression[66]. Several additional genes associated with cell growth and differentiation including Myod1, Twist1, and Egr1 were also altered in spaceflight (Fig. 5A,Table 3). Myod1 is known for its function in muscle cells where it causes increased differentiation through activation of p21[67]. Myod1, however, is also broadly expressed in other tissues and down-regulation of Myod1 message is suggestive of decreased p21-mediated cell differentiation. In agreement with this, Twist 1, known to be involved in differentiation by inhibiting DNA binding by Myod1 and transactivation by Mef2, was up-regulated. Decreased Myod1 expression suggests a decrease in CDKN1a/p21 levels associated with cell differentiation, and leads us to hypothesize that the CDKN1a/p21 elevation we observe in spaceflight is independent of differentiation, and possibly induced by the oxidative stress related to reduced mechanical load in microgravity. Egr1 has been shown to be regulated by c-Fos[68], however, Egr1 activation has also been shown to occur independently of c-Fos through activation of the Erk 1/2 pathway in response to shear stress. Although the exact mechanism regulating Egr1 activity is not examined here, down-regulation of this molecule has important implications for cell growth and differentiation due to its potential role in the regulation of over 30 genes. Furthermore, decreased levels of Egr1 leads to decreased formation of the Egr1/Sp1 complex resulting in increased levels of free Sp1 available for binding to the m-CSF promoter, increased m-CSF expression, and consequently, more osteoclast formation[69]. The observed decreases in TGF-β message could also contribute to decreased Egr-1 expression.

Vitamin D receptor and Sox9, two transcription factors involved in osteogenesis, were also differentially expressed in spaceflight. Vdr gene expression is stimulated by Ras/Raf/MAP kinase signaling through the AP-1 site on the Vdr promoter[46],[70]. Vitamin D has been shown to modulate NFκB activity in multiple cell types, which suggests a role for the Vitamin D receptor in regulation of the NFκB pathway. Vdr-null mice have been shown to have decreased IκBα levels due to loss of vdr-p65 interaction affecting NFκB transcriptional activity[48]. This could provide an additional mechanism for the observed inhibition of NFκB activation in our spaceflight samples. The MAP kinase-ERK pathway is also known to activate the transcription factor Sox9[71], which is a regulatory factor required for chondrocyte differentiation[72]. Activation of Sox9 by p38-MAP kinase signaling results in chondrocyte growth and differentiation while depression of Sox9 transcription results in cartilage degeneration and osteo-arthritis[55],[73]. Additionally, Sox9 is important for extracellular matrix production[73]. P38-MAP kinase down-regulation and loss of Sox9 transcriptional activation may therefore have important implications for cartilage health and regeneration, and matrix production in spaceflight. Rps6kb1, a down-stream effector of the Pi3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, was also down-regulated in spaceflight (Table 3), and is involved in cell proliferation through the activation of protein synthesis by Eif4e and inhibition of apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD (for full review see[56]).","In total, our findings demonstrate the pelvic-femoral musculo-skeletal complex as a highly load and gravity sensitive structure that can serve as a valuable model to study muscle and bone degeneration in space. Additionally, we demonstrate that bone responses to spaceflight are complex and involve osteoclastic, osteoblastic, and osteocytic degenerative responses. Finally, our findings on CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity have the potential to become a major concern for tissue regenerative health in long-duration spaceflight. Future studies should address the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms of CDKN1a/p21 involvement in tissue degeneration during long-term spaceflight and the possibility of systemic activation of this strong molecular inhibitor of regenerative adult stem cell proliferation.",
Stem Cell Health and Tissue Regeneration in Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988870/,"Recent research demonstrates that microgravity significantly influences a wide array of biological processes, including immune responses, cell proliferation, and tissue regeneration. This unique environment disrupts key mechanisms such as mitochondrial biogenesis, liver metabolism, intestinal homeostasis, and stem cell differentiation, with profound implications for human health, particularly during prolonged space travel (Table 1).

Advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on stem cells, T cells, and immune function have created new opportunities for therapeutic innovations. Alterations in cellular biology under microgravity conditions have been shown to affect diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, kidney dysfunction, and infertility. Additionally, changes observed in endothelial cell behavior and multi-organ homeostasis highlight microgravity’s potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine and deepen our understanding of human physiology in extreme environments.

Microgravity also holds significant promise for personalized medicine by facilitating progress in regenerative therapies, immune-based treatments, and approaches to managing chronic diseases. These findings emphasize microgravity’s transformative potential to reshape cellular biology and its application to contemporary medical challenges, both in space and on Earth.

As a defining characteristic of space environments, microgravity imposes profound and multidimensional effects on biological and physiological systems, challenging conventional notions of human adaptation. The near-total absence of gravitational forces disrupts numerous bodily processes, posing risks to health during and after space missions. Key effects include fluid redistribution, increased intracranial pressure, muscle atrophy, and calcium-related bone density loss. At the molecular level, microgravity alters gene expression, cell signaling, and mitochondrial function, with significant consequences for energy production and cellular health [37,38,39].

In the immune system, microgravity reduces T cell activity and suppresses immune responses, increasing susceptibility to infections. These effects highlight the necessity of mitigating immune dysfunction during space travel. Similarly, studies have documented changes in the human microbiome, with potential implications for astronaut health and nutritional strategies during prolonged missions.

Microgravity research has also led to technological and medical breakthroughs with applications beyond space exploration. For instance, the study of proteins and drug crystals under microgravity has produced purer and more stable structures, offering new therapeutic possibilities for chronic diseases. Additionally, materials research in space has contributed to the development of innovative compounds with applications in both space and terrestrial industries. These advancements enhance the safety and efficiency of space missions while delivering broad scientific and technological benefits [39,40].

Despite these advances, the complex effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity underline the need for further research, particularly in anticipation of missions to Mars and other distant destinations. Experimental models, such as space platforms and terrestrial simulators, remain indispensable tools for understanding the long-term impacts of microgravity and developing effective countermeasures [37,49].

The study of microgravity not only expands our understanding of how the human body adapts to extreme environments but also drives innovations with profound implications for science, medicine, and technology. By pushing the boundaries of what is known, this research establishes itself as a cornerstone for advancements that extend beyond space exploration, reshaping our perspectives on biology and human health [37,40].","Microgravity presents a unique and multifaceted challenge for human biology, profoundly influencing cellular systems and physiological processes. This environment, distinct from terrestrial conditions, disrupts key biological functions such as immune activity, cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby destabilizing homeostasis critical for human health.

Emerging research has highlighted the diverse effects of microgravity, including its impact on the immune system, where T cell function diminishes, increasing susceptibility to infections. Additionally, cancer cells exhibit altered behavior under microgravity, providing new insights into tumor progression and potential therapeutic approaches. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into how microgravity influences disease mechanisms and treatment responses.

Microgravity also affects the physiology of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and bones, with implications for understanding tissue regeneration. Notably, stem cells exposed to microgravity demonstrate enhanced potential to produce mature, functional cells such as cardiomyocytes, offering transformative possibilities in regenerative medicine for repairing damaged cardiac tissue and other applications.

The continued exploration of microgravity’s effects is essential not only for safeguarding astronaut health during prolonged space missions but also for advancing therapeutic strategies on Earth. The ability of microgravity to induce unique biological changes offers unparalleled opportunities to innovate in regenerative medicine, cancer treatment, and the management of immune dysfunctions.

By leveraging microgravity as a research platform, medicine and biotechnology stand to gain transformative insights and novel applications, extending the boundaries of our understanding of human biology and driving the development of therapies that can improve health outcomes both in space and on Earth.",
Microgravity Reduces the Differentiation and Regenerative Potential of Embryonic Stem Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998608/,"Through novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have been shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer potentially greater translational benefits. SSEA-3(+) Muse cells, a representative type of highly functional mesenchymal stem cell, are known to show superior multipotency compared to regular stem cells [32]. However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow hASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with higher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs to only approximately 1% [19]. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical and environmental stress greatly influences proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and the multipotency of stem cells [33,34]. Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been the most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant influence on cultured cells.

Numerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell proliferation [35] and differentiation [36,37]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38]. Therefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated, unaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to previous studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity vector to an average of 10−3×gover time [24]. In our experimental system, although cells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the microspheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells’ gravity vectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their final cumulative gravity vectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been developed [39,40], but they involve significant costs and are very difficult to standardize. Moreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-proliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions for the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41].

In previous studies, micro-scale carriers fabricated from a variety of natural and synthetic polymers have shown significant potential for cell growth, specific differentiation, and the delivery of hASCs [42,43]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation has been carried out on the feasibility of culturing cells using stirred microspheres for the stated purpose of mimicking a microgravity environment. The outcomes of this study exceeded our expectations. Seven days of polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures under static conditions produced an increased number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to polystyrene dish cultures, and those under dynamic conditions exhibited a much higher number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. These results clearly revealed a positive influence of microspheres on the selective proliferation of SSEA-3(+) cells, especially in those experiments combined with a microgravity environment.

By comparison, our stress-exposure treatments were not very suitable for the expansion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. Heneidi et al. reported that Muse cells could be isolated from lipoaspirates using severe cellular stress, such as long-term exposure to collagenase [44]. We also confirmed that exposure to proteolysis produced the best results among our stress conditions, increasing the proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs by 3.3-fold (4.2%) compared to monolayer cultures (1.3%). During preliminary studies (unpublished data) to enhance the ratio of SSEA-3(+) hASCs (known to be stress-tolerant [19,32]), stress magnitude was carefully optimized in each experiment. However, because 37.6% of viable cells were lost, the final number of proteolytic solution-treated SSEA-3(+) hASCs was only 1.3-fold more (1.7 × 103) compared to the controls (1.3 × 103), with no statistically significant difference. These results suggest that exposure to severe stress can concentrate SSEA-3(+) hASCs through the selective depletion of SSEA-3(−) cells, but such stress can also inhibit cell proliferation. Instead of concentration, microsphere cultures under microgravity conditions increased SSEA-3(+) hASCs by proliferation (Figure 9). In other words, the present microgravity culture conditions increased not only the proportion, but also the number, of SSEA-3(+) cells to actualize regenerative therapies requiring these highly therapeutic cells. However, a limitation of this study is that we only assessed SSEA-3 as a pluripotent marker in stress-exposure experiments. Additional research including analyses of the other pluripotent markers (e.g., Oct4 and Sox2) may further emphasize the differences between microgravity cultures and stress-exposure cultures, or reveal new characteristics of the two cultures.

Furthermore, hASCs harvested from microgravity–microsphere cultures had higher expression levels of the pluripotent markersOCT4,SOX2,NANOG,MYC,KLF, andCD34compared to hASCs cultured in monolayers.OCT4andNANOGare known to be involved in the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells, whileSOX2,MYC, andKLFexpression act as transcription factors to control genes involved during embryonic development [19]. CD34 has been reported to contribute to the proliferative ability of hASCs both by us [23,45] and by others [46,47]. However, the upregulation of nuclear stem-cell markers was hardly detected in hASCs from static microsphere cultures, suggesting that the microgravity environment may play a key role in preserving hASC functionality. In a previous report, spaceflight experiments demonstrated that altered gene expression was associated with epigenetic changes, such as chromatin re-modeling and DNA methylation [48]. The present results extend these observations by demonstrating improved proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation into mesenchymal lineages (adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes) in hASCs from microgravity–microsphere cultures compared to hASCs from cultures under normal conditions. However, the fold change of the genes analyzed by RT-PCR was not so large in this study (less than 1.5), and future studies are required for further qualification of these genes through optimization of the microgravity culture protocols.

Interestingly, the efficacies for collagen and polystyrene microspheres to select for proliferation in highly functional hASCs were roughly equivalent in the present study. Polystyrene microbeads require a plasma coating prior to use to enable good cell attachment; therefore, collagen microbeads may be the superior practical choice for regenerative therapy applications. In addition, as a biodegradable biomaterial, collagen has the advantage that such beads may be clinically administered into a target organ together with hASCs; it may even augment hASC survival and functionality after transplantation by acting as a biological cell scaffold [1,42].","We cultured hASCs with microspheres using three-dimensional movement to create microgravity conditions for the preservation of stemness, while at the same time preserving cell–microsphere adhesion to maximize cell quantities. This new cell-culturing technique selectively enhanced the proliferation of highly functional stem cells, demonstrating superior stemness, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenic abilities, which may provide for enhanced treatments for intractable human diseases compared to current hASC treatments. However, further studies are required to optimize a culture protocol to maximize the selective expansion efficiency and to investigate the therapeutic value of these cells using in vivo experiments before clinical trials can proceed.",
Microgravity validation of a novel system for RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real time PCR analysis of gene expression on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587110/,"One of the major obstacles to space exploration going forward in the coming decades is the fact that microgravity research outposts such as ISS are so closely dependent on Earth support of everyday activities, and lack the ability to operate autonomously. The National Academies of Sciences in their Decadal Survey [5] have identified some of these limitations as important concerns and offered direction that the ISS should operate more like Earth-based laboratories, allowing for experiments to be designed, conducted, modified and iterated in space. Despite the thousands of investigations already conducted on ISS [31], there are still overwhelming limitations [32,33] that prevent science and specifically molecular biology measurements of gene expression from being conducted and analyzed on-orbit.

From its inception, the NASA WetLab-2 project has sought to address these concerns by introducing new, time-efficient, practical and flexible molecular biology gene expression analysis capabilities to the ISS. The WetLab-2 hardware system can now rapidly perform RNA isolation on-orbit and use those RNAs to immediately conduct RT-qPCR analyses, or other novel analyses such as nanopore-based RNA sequencing. The utility of WetLab-2 can be applied to many molecular biology experimental designs using a variety of sample types and provides investigators with improved insight and interactivity during experimentation. Overall, the on-orbit process of total RNA isolation and gene expression analysis is accomplished in a span of approximately 3 h without the requirement for a highly experienced user and provides a new capability to ISS that will greatly expand the limits of possible on-orbit science.

Successful development and deployment of the WetLab-2 system to the ISS depended on solving a number of challenges such as limited refrigeration availability, hazardous reagent use allowances, power consumption, and availability of crew time. In addition, the suite of hardware and fluidic components had to function in microgravity and provide ease of use for non-expert operators.

In order to perform thermal cycling on-orbit, a suitable, commercially available thermal cycler that was capable of operating in a microgravity environment was identified. Specifically, the Cepheid SmartCycler best met the requirements without significant modifications. The instrument is modular, has reduced power requirements and offers assay wells with individual thermal protocol programming allowing for simultaneous running of assays with different optimal primer annealing temperatures. Validation testing of this instrument included physical durability tests and validation of all 16 sample sites.

TaqMan assays were selected because of the ability to multiplex assays with multiple color probes in a single tube, and because alternatives such as SYBRGreen DNA intercalating dyes are carcinogenic, resulting in safety concerns for the ISS crew and imposing elevated containment requirements.

Next we developed a RNA isolation and RT-qPCR workflow using non-hazardous reagents suitable for room temperature storage. A RNA binding column and cell lysis system for RNA purification was selected from Claremont BioSolutions for its ease of integration [21,22]. In collaboration with Claremont, the RNA extraction protocol was modified to meet room temperature storage and low toxicity requirements. RNA extracted from the SPM proved to be of sufficient high quality and quantity for gene expression studies utilizing RT-qPCR (Fig 3B). Longevity testing of loaded SPMs showed no degradation of the reagents for at least 26 weeks (S2 Text).

We proceeded to develop a lyophilized all-in-one detection assay to minimize crew time and storage requirements. Lacking instruments to evaluate RNA purity and potential gDNA contamination, intron-spanning primers that give a product approximately 100 bases in length were used in eukaryotic samples. In prokaryotic samples, DNase enzyme [34] was included due to the lack of introns in the coding region [35]. To ensure that lyophilized assays provided similar results to those obtained using wet bench chemistry, we performed extensive validation testing. Our results indicate no significant differences between lyophilized and commercial non-lyophilized assays (seeTable 2). When refrigerated, the lyophilized assays were stable with a shelf life of at least 52 weeks (S2 Text). To provide longer shelf life and room temperature storage conditions in the future, we plan to use the standard commercial caps, as they appear to perform better in initial results from ongoing long-term storage tests.

Before the WetLab-2 system could be made available to researchers, the system was validated to ensure that the data obtained on-orbit was not affected or biased by microgravity conditions, including surface tension-dominated fluid dynamics and lack of convection [36]. Specifically, because PCR consists of repeated cycles of rapid heating and cooling, lack of gravity-induced convection mixing in microgravity may limit heat transfer throughout the sample to only conduction which may require longer denaturation and annealing/extension times.

To validate PCR efficiency in microgravity, control qPCR reactions were conducted once the system was installed on-orbit. These tests included validation with a range of pre-prepared DNA template concentrations (low, mid and high) to assess PCR efficiency. Three replicate runs were conducted, of which two were successful in returning qPCR amplification curves that showed close correlation to 1 g controls. Furthermore, the microgravity Ct results were comparable to their respective 1 g controls (Fig 2andS1 Table). Although amplification was successful, microgravity data showed increased variability within replicate sets. Analysis of the amplification plots, post-assay tube windows, and follow up experiments suggest that this increased variability may be caused by degassing bubble formation that interferes with fluorescence detection. In subsequent ground-based experiments, we found that these bubbles rise out of the tube detection window under normal 1 g conditions. Conversely, in microgravity, bubbles form, are retained and expand in the tube optical window during thermocycling, creating noise (choppiness) in the resulting amplification curves. Despite higher variability when using septa caps, our data show that qPCR can be conducted in the SmartCycler using TaqMan assays in microgravity conditions, and that resulting Ct values are comparable to those of 1 g controls, albeit noisier (Fig 2G & 2H). These results indicate that the physical alterations of fluid and thermal dynamics in microgravity are not sufficient to alter enzymatic amplification of DNA during PCR thermal cycling in the SmartCycler.

To validate that the WetLab-2 system could successfully isolate RNA from intact cells and tissue, as well as perform RT-qPCR analyses on-orbit, we prepared and froze samples ofE.coliand mouse liver tissue on the ground. Results show that RNA was successfully isolated on-orbit using the SPM and that singleplex and multiplex RT-qPCR analyses from bothE.colicells and mouse liver tissues resulted in successful qPCR amplification (Fig 3andS1 Table). Successful multiplex RT-qPCR allows for the use of ratiometric methods; expression of genes of interest can be measured relative to reference genes in the same tube, thereby effectively normalizing variability that may exist in RNA concentrations or other artifacts of microgravity PCR amplification.

Comparison of raw background fluorescence data showed significant differences between microgravity and 1 g control samples (S1 File), however, no significant differences in Ct values. In agreement with genomic DNA standards data, increased variability was also observed in the microgravity samples using SPM-derivedE.coliand mouse RNA, likely due to bubble formation during thermal cycling.

As this variability in Ct values may limit the utility of the system for researchers, a follow up “volunteer science” experiment was conducted by astronaut Kate Rubins. This test was aimed at reducing or eliminating bubbles formed during thermal cycling and showed that the positive pressure formed in the tubes when closed using a standard cap drastically reduces bubbles and results in smooth amplification curves similar to those typically seen during RT-qPCR runs in 1 g (Fig 4). This run yielded data with less variability; standard deviations up to 0.659 Ct for standard caps compared to 1.035 Ct for septa caps. Therefore, for future experiments, we intend to use standard commercial tubes to suppress degassing bubble formation.

Through these experiments, we have demonstrated that qPCR can be successfully performed in the microgravity environment of space and developed an system of molecular biology tools and reagents for extracting and quantitatively analyzing RNA from biological samples on-orbit and generating RT-qPCR Ct data (See photos of actual on-orbit operations inFig 5).

In conclusion, the WetLab-2 ISS system is now validated and ready for future end-to-end gene expression analysis on-orbit, providing prompt results and data reporting from multiple cell and tissue biological samples. This new capability allows investigators unprecedented flexibility with ISS research and the opportunity to re-design and iterate experiments based on data received in almost real-time. The WetLab2 system is publicly available to investigators for research on ISS [37] and can also potentially be used to analyze environmental samples, for medical diagnostics, or to provide purified RNA and cDNAs for expressome sequencing and global gene expression analysis using nanopore sequencing [17] as our group recently demonstrated [38]. Overall the novel molecular biology capabilities we describe here for for ISS, although trivial on earth, are an important step forward in the quest for making possible the exploration and development of space for human use.",A seção 'Conclusion' não foi encontrada.,
Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396460/,"Our findings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level to the novel environment of space. Spaceflight experiments using rodents present unique practical challenges though similar benefits to rodent studies on Earth. The animals flown in space during this particular mission were deemed healthy, as assessed by veterinary examination after return to Earth, and the finding that animal body weights were comparable in FLT mice compared to GRD controls at the termination of the study. Further, numerous scientific reports from these mice describe related results obtained studying other organ systems (e.g., [30,32,33]). The RNA samples recovered from the hearts were consistent and of high quality. Therefore, we conclude that the results we obtained from this mission were valid.

Whereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of cardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited [12,13,34,35,36]. Goldstein et al. [12] report that spaceflight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes in rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac atrophy. Short duration (6 days) spaceflight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of mitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle [34]. More recently, long duration spaceflight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation-related genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly, lifetime exposure ofDrosophilato microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dysfunction, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities [36]. Furthermore, spaceflight causes cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression profile consistent with early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle [37]. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related genes provides novel findings on how the heart responds to spaceflight at the tissue level.","In conclusion, our study revealed that spaceflight significantly altered cardiac expression of genes related to cell cycle/growth (notablyCdkn1a/p21, Cdk1,andMyc), inflammation (notablyTnf) and oxidative stress (notablyNfe2l2,Nox1, Ptgs2), which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. These findings provide novel data suitable for developing testable hypotheses for further study. Identification of specific mechanisms and molecules responsible for excess ROS generation during spaceflight is of considerable interest, and may yield new therapeutic approaches.",
Dose- and Ion-Dependent Effects in the Oxidative Stress Response to Space-Like Radiation Exposure in the Skeletal System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666799/,"Heavy-ion irradiation during space missions is a risk to the skeletal health of astronauts, causing skeletal degeneration and cellular damage in simulations with rodents [12,20,24]. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of radiation type and changes in the oxidative milieu of bone marrow related to marrow-derived osteoprogenitor differentiation. We found that low doses (below 50 cGy) of either low-LET protons or high-LET56Fe did not cause observable adverse effects on structure and osteoblastogenesis at any endpoint, and, further, did not strongly perturb antioxidant capacity at seven days of exposure (Figure 6) nor expression levels of redox-related genes (Figure 4,Table 2) at 35 days of exposure. In contrast, only a high dose of56Fe radiation (200 cGy) was sufficient to induce detrimental effects on total antioxidant capacity, bone structure, and osteoprogenitor populations of the marrow (Figure 3,Figure 4,Figure 5andFigure 6). These changes were associated with transient elevations in mRNA levels (Figure 4C,D) of an antioxidant gene (Catalase) and a DNA-damage/cell cycle arrest marker (Gadd45) during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis, which we speculate indicates persistent oxidative stress or enhanced antioxidant defenses during the proliferative phase. Interestingly, cultures showed a trend towards elevation of osteocalcin (Bglap,Figure 4D), a late marker of differentiation, during the proliferative phase, which may indicate that56Fe exposure accelerated differentiation.

Body mass and coat color were assessed as general indices of animal health. Body mass indicated that animals showed a modest and transient decline in response to56Fe irradiation with 200 cGy (Figure 2), consistent with our previous studies [17]. Additionally,56Fe irradiation at 200 cGy uniquely caused a shift in coat color from black to grey (Table 1). We interpret this as a hallmark of oxidative stress in the hair follicle [25], and, when coupled with the osteoprogenitor effects, this may signal premature aging in a second tissue, in line with the free-radical theory of cellular aging [26,27].

In rodents, radiation injury to bone between with56Fe (10–200 cGy, 1 GeV/n) [17] manifests as acute cell death of marrow cells and concomitant cancellous bone loss driven by osteoclasts [12,22,28]. In this work, we showed that high-dose56Fe or proton (200 cGy) caused a transient reduction in antioxidant capacity in the marrow microenvironment (Figure 6), potentially indicative of a depletion of extracellular antioxidant stores with subsequent recovery of the extracellular antioxidant defense system [29]. These findings are consistent with our data showing the marrow cell response to increase mRNA expression levels of the master antioxidant transcription factor,Nrf2, shown previously [13], and with effects also evident in a cell line at even higher doses [19]. Our group showed that a dietary supplement rich in antioxidants and polyphenols (dried plum) prevents bone loss andNrf2induction from γ irradiation in mice [30], supportive of the role of oxidative stress in driving acute bone loss. Additionally, in vitro, 200 cGy56Fe impairs osteoblastogenesis [17]. Our work extends this high-dose impairment in vivo and to five weeks and one year post-exposure, suggesting an irreversible insult to osteoblastogenesis.

Gene expression analyses during the proliferative phase (Figure 4D) revealed that a high dose of56Fe (200 cGy) increased the expression of genes for the cell cycle arrest markerGadd45and antioxidantCatalaserelative to sham. These data are consistent with a G2/M arrest from high-LET irradiation of mesenchymal stem cells [18], a pre-osteoblast cell line [31], and many other cell types [32]. Interestingly, these two genes are targets ofFoxotranscription factors [33,34,35]. Nrf2, Foxos, and p21 are critical to the antioxidant response element [36]. Oxidative stress activates Foxo transcription factors [37] and interferes with Wnt signaling [14,38,39,40]. Hence, our data suggest Foxo activation may play a role in56Fe irradiation, decreasing osteoprogenitor cell proliferation, and, ultimately, mineralization levels.

During the mineralization phase (Figure 4A,B),56Fe irradiation (200 cGy) tended to reduce nodule formation and alkaline phosphatase gene expression, suggesting a reduction in early markers of early-stage osteoblast differentiation and fewer cells contributing to nodule formation, consistent with in vitro evidence for high-dose effects [19]. Taken together with gene expression data, these findings suggest that irradiation induced persistent oxidative stress that impaired colony formation via reduced proliferation (e.g., delayed or halted cell division) leading to lower extent of mineralization. Higher doses of γ irradiation (>500 cGy) are required to recapitulate the impairment of osteoblastogenesis [41,42], where changes are also associated with oxidative damage [43]. Taking these findings into consideration, the sequelae of a high-dose of heavy-ion irradiation are likely impaired osteoblastogenesis, which may be attributable to persistent oxidative stress.

For evaluating structural responses, we analyzed cancellous regions in the tibia (Figure 3) and the cortical midshaft of the femur (Table 1) at two time points for parameters indicative of structural integrity. At 5-weeks after irradiation, exposure to high-LET56Fe irradiation at or above 50 cGy caused decrements in fractional bone volume and trabecular number, and increases in trabecular spacing (Figure 3), indicating a significant deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture, consistent with previous findings [20,22,44]. The magnitude of the changes caused by protons or56Fe were similar, although the effect of protons at 50 cGy on BV/TV was not statistically significant (p= 0.12). Thus, these findings indicate that the threshold for a persistent,56Fe radiation-induced response lies between 10 and 50 cGy—doses relevant to exploration missions [11]. Overall, we show that a high dose of radiation was able to induce persistent decrements in cancellous bone, regardless of radiation type (Figure 3). Others have shown that these changes persist to four months post-exposure [22]. In this study, the structural decrement affected by56Fe (200 cGy) was resolved one year after exposure due to the expected age-related decline in sham-control animals changes over time (Table 1), likely the product of age-induced elevations of osteoclasts overtaking waning bone formation by osteoblasts [45]. These data are consistent with our previous findings from growing female mice after exposure to low-LET γ radiation [46]. Although others have shown cortical changes following irradiation with either low-LET γ at high doses (500 cGy) [47] or high-LET56Fe at 50 cGy [48], no irradiation-induced cortical responses at 1-year post exposure were evident in this study [23], or in other experiments we have performed in the past. Thus, the influence of ionizing radiation at 200 cGy or below appears to be restricted to the more metabolically-active cancellous tissue.

In vitro irradiation studies were conducted to further assess the role of oxidative stress in radiation damage to osteoprogenitors. Our approach was to test antioxidants and their capacity to rescue radiation effects to provide insight into the different mechanisms between low-LET radiation and high-LET radiation [31]. Although similar doses of low-LET radiation are generally less deleterious than high-LET radiation, the mechanisms for radiation damage to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors in the context of oxidative stress are not fully elucidated [49,50,51]. When comparing the effects of low-LET radiation (137Cs) and high-LET radiation (56Fe), we found high-LET irradiation was more damaging with respect to growth of the cell population, as assessed by a surrogate assay (changes in DNA content over time). Furthermore, exogenous SOD effectively protected osteoprogenitors from low-LET radiation damage, but only minimally from56Fe at 100 cGy, and not at all from56Fe at 200 cGy. Taken together, these findings indicate excess extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibited growth, and that oxidative stress is possibly the main mechanism involved in low-LET radiodamage to osteoprogenitors; in contrast, high-LET species likely affect the cells via additional detrimental mechanisms, such as double-strand DNA breaks.

Although others [52,53] have shown the beneficial effects of various antioxidants to confer radioprotection for various osteoblast cell lines, we show here a direct comparison of antioxidant treatment with different radiation species when added to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors. Interestingly, adding SOD at higher doses or for longer periods was not advantageous, emphasizing the importance of carefully titrating radical scavengers such as SOD, possibly to maintain endogenous ROS-dependent signalling.

In sum, we showed the ability of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) to mitigate the adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays (used for the low-LET radiation), but not to an equivalent dose of high-LET56Fe. Our results strengthen the potential application of SOD as a countermeasure for low-LET irradiation-induced damage to marrow stem cells and osteoprogenitors.

Inherent limitations of these experiments with respect to radiation exposures include: (1) exposures were delivered at high dose-rate and fluence in a matter of minutes, whereas in space, the same dose is delivered at a lower rate, and (2) space exposures are mixed doses, rather than a single species (e.g., SPE can deliver 100–200 cGy over days and GCR over years). In addition, with respect to relevance to spaceflight, these experiments were performed in mice that were normally ambulatory, thus not subjected to musculoskeletal disuse and fluid shifts, which are induced by microgravity; groundbased models for spaceflight have shown that unloading can influence radiosensitivity [17,24,54,55].

In summary, our findings indicate that although low doses of radiation do not show lasting effects on skeletal health, a high dose of high-LET56Fe impairs osteoblast growth and maturation by adversely affecting growth of osteoprogenitors. There were few, select changes in steady-state expression of redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis ex vivo after total body irradiation with56Fe (but not protons), with some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase. Furthermore, scavenging ROS with antioxidants, such as SOD, mitigated the adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays (200 cGy), but failed to protect from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions. Together, our findings indicate that high-dose radiation has a persistent effect to impair bone formation by adversely affecting growth, but not differentiation, of osteoprogenitors.",A seção 'Conclusion' não foi encontrada.,
